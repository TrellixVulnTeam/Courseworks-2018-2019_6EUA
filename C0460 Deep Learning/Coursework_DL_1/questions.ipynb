    "1. To estimate a supervised learning model's performance on unseen data, we can use either the mean squared error or the cross-entropy between the training data and the model distribution, as the cost function. The mean squared error enables to have the average output value for each observation. The cross-entropy is the negative log-likelihood and has better results in deep learning applications. Indeed, for gradient-based algorithms, the saturation of some outputs leads to small gradient values and hence to mediocre results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To improve generalisation performance, we could try:\n",
    "    - Regularisation with a norm penalty: by choosing a parameter norm penalty for the weights (e.g., $L^2$ regularisation), we can obtain effects such as more weights close to zero.\n",
    "    -  Multi-task learning: by pooling examples, we create several tasks with shared parameters, which can also be seen as a kind of constraints on the parameters, thus leading to a better generalisation.\n",
    "    - Early stopping: the training error always decreases with time and the test error increases after a certain threshold, which causes overfitting. By stopping the training earlier, we can hope to have a lower test error.\n",
    "    - Bagging: by training several models and make them vote on the test set, we can try to have a better generalisation performance, since different models will not make the same errors."

    "1. The sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent are related with $tanh(z) = 2 \\sigma(2z) âˆ’ 1$. Since the sigmoid function saturates on a wide domain, gradient-based learning is thus difficult with those functions. It is the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the loss function can remove the saturation in the output layer, the previous problem is less relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For a multi-layer fully-connected neural network, if all the weights are set to zero (and hence all the same value), the neural network will calculate the same function across the layers. Indeed, we will then have the same weights over the whole neural network, which is not useful. That is why for neural networks, we use a random distribution of weights. Conversely, for a logistic regression model, there is no such problem; a weight of zero means that the sigmoid function is in the linear area, which is convenient.\n"
