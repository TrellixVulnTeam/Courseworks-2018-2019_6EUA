The result has been generated thanks to a convolution neural network with one embedding layer, one convolution layer, one dropout layer and one linear layer. The output layer has one neuron, since it is a binary classification. 

The model has been optimised with a stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.05 and the a momentum of 0.5. Those values were found thanks to a grid search.

The used features are the indices of each word in a dictionary.

I only used the given training data to train the model. Moreover, the data has been preprocessed mainly by tokenising, removing stopwords and lemmatising.
